Along with automatic evaluation and score tracking, AutoLab provides a comprehensive set of services, including grading, assignment distribution, code annotation, plagiarism detection, and more."}</div>

These led to downtime and incorrect feedback for students, causing classes to reschedule assignments. To prevent future issues, we designed DevU with stability and reliability in mind, reducing the need for unscheduled maintenance and outages. To illustrate the reliability issues faced by Autolab, I have included a graph from the Tango VMs showing the number of job errors and job failures. As you can see from the graph, the rate of errors and failures is small but the number is usually less than 5. However this is still relatively high, leading to the need for a more stable solution. That's why we've built DevU with stability and reliability as our top priority."}</div>

My first task was to familiarize myself with the project structure and make necessary corrections, such as fixing typos. As I gained a better understanding of the code, I became increasingly involved in coding and committing changes. My first entity involved creating controller tests for the courses and assignments entities, which involved handling HTTP requests and verifying their correct handling. Once the work on the courses and assignments entities was finalized and merged with the master branch, I was tasked with completing the Submissions entity on my own."}</div>
