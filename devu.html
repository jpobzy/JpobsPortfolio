      <dd id="list">An open source project designed to grade university studentsâ€™ coding homework submissions against numerous tests generated by instructors, this project was designed by multiple computer science instructors and other industry consultants to re-create the auto-grading API for the University at Buffalo but can also be used/edited by multiple institutions. As a contributor to the project, I played a role in developing and improving the grading system by assisting in the creation and testing of the courses, assignments, and submissions entities.

      <dd id="list">- AutoLab is a sophisticated course management platform developed by Carnegie Mellon University students and faculty. It offers instructors automated programming assessments and tracks scores via web-based technology. Along with automatic evaluation and score tracking, AutoLab provides a comprehensive set of services, including grading, assignment distribution, code annotation, plagiarism detection, and more.</dd>
      <dd id="list">- Our goal was to redesign and enhance the existing version of the AutoLab system utilized by the University at Buffalo for the evaluation of students' programming assignments.</dd>
      <dd id="list">- Our team, composed of alumni with experience on the AutoLab system, undertook a comprehensive redevelopment. During the process, I honed my project management and teamwork skills and gained insights into executing real-world programming projects.</dd>

      <dd id="list">Autolab faced reliability issues, including poor performance and grading inaccuracies. These led to downtime and incorrect feedback for students, causing classes to reschedule assignments. To prevent future issues, we designed DevU with stability and reliability in mind, reducing the need for unscheduled maintenance and outages.</dd>

        <dd id="list">
          The Scoreboard in AutoLab elevates the student experience with its real-time display of anonymous, autograded scores that foster a sense of community and friendly competition. This dynamic duo of autograding and scoreboard creates an optimal learning atmosphere that inspires students to perform at their best, while keeping them informed and on track.

        <dd id="list">
          Tango is a powerful web service that drives the efficiency of Autolab's job management. It provides secure isolation for student code by provisioning Docker containers and reporting results to the Autolab UI. This leads to increased scalability, ensuring that submissions can be processed quickly and efficiently, while minimizing the risk of malware.
